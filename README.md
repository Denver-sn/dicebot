# dicebot
This is the code of a Telegram bot that allows you to roll a common dice (with six sides).
It has been written in Python 3 and it works with the telepot library. 
I hope this code will be useful to develop more complex bot or, simply, animate your GDR matches. 
The bot support multilanguage; for now it works only with italian and english. 
In the repository there is also a nice icon that you can use for your bot. It is licensed under GNU GPL. I founder it here: https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/freebie-of-the-week/beautiful-flat-icons-for-free.
